- :ocean: Hi, my name is Silas and I'm a marine biologist. I work as an assistant researcher for the [Ocean Biodiversity Information System (OBIS)](https://obis.org/).
- :tropical_fish: My research interests focus primarily on how climate change affects ecosystems, with experience in distribution modelling, thermal biology, and ecophysiology.
- :globe_with_meridians: I like to work with spatial data and remote sensing. I'm trying to use these data to predict patterns of distribution of key species in the future.
- :chart_with_upwards_trend: My favorite programming language is R, but I also use Python sometimes. I'm now learning React and Svelte.
- :email: You can contact me through the email s.principe@unesco.org. You can also find me at [silasprincipe.com](https://silasprincipe.github.io/)
