- :ocean: Hi, my name is Silas and I'm a marine biologist. I'm currently doing my PhD in Oceanography at IO-USP (Brazil).
- :tropical_fish: I’m researching how climate change will impact coral reef species in the Atlantic.
- :globe_with_meridians: I like to work with spatial data and remote sensing. I'm trying to use these data to predict patterns of distribution of key species in the future.
- :chart_with_upwards_trend: In this research project R became my best friend, but I'm also trying to learn Python and gain new skills on Google Earth Engine.
- :email: You can contact me through the email silasprincipe@usp.br. I'm also on Twitter [@silasprincipe](https://twitter.com/silasprincipe). You can also find me at [silasprincipe.github.io](https://silasprincipe.github.io/)
